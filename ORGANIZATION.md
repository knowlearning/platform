# KnowLearning Organizational Statements

## Mission

To elevate global learning by lowering technical barriers for
students, teachers, researchers, and organizations to
effectively create, consume, evaluate, improve, re-mix and
re-use digital learning experiences.

## Vision

We see a future where learners everywhere have free access to
world class learning experiences and well structured ways to
interact with them that are appropriate to their situations and
goals, whatever they may be.

## Goals

We aim to provide the go-to option for cutting-edge, reliable,
universally available, and fairly and transparently priced
technical infrastructure for re-mixable learning experiences;
while never compromising our non-stick technology values.

## Values

Technology should be optimized to serve end users, not to
enrich providers. KnowLearning is a registered non-profit to
keep it oriented toward a mission far more important than share
price.
