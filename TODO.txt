X Cache config in serve/configuration.js !!!
X Fix infinite auth loop when user token is expired
X Remove default scope concept from embedded agent and root agent
X Test metadata pull for new approach
X Test uploads and downloads
X Move uploads and downloads to type backed scopes
X Reset needs to remove active, not set to null
X Fix test postgres config timeouts by reducing pressure on db
X Use js Date param trick for postgres wrapper to simplify query for metadata side effect
X Fix up and test all SQL mirror operations
X Better error behavior when special scope queries are broken
X Make root agent show default scope
X Fix expired auth token
X Use secure httpOnly cookies for ws sessions
X Move upload and download metadata to new format
X Allow Agent.download(id).direct() and Agent.download(id).url()

X Fix old session messages getting queued and passed to new sessions (because of using cookie sid instead of client prvided session)
X Handlable "close" event from embedded agents
X Batch inserts into postgres
X  await Agent.watch(id, updateFn) should probably await until the first call of updateFn (cannot do because Agent.watch returns the unwatch function)
  Use referrer to make sure we reconnect sessions to the domain the session was created for
  Joining teacher in PILA app does not trigger SQL sync
  Surface warning message in app for case where SID does not exist in incognito (link to docs on disabling setting in empty incognito tab)
  Figure out how to deal with this breaking login: https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/storage-partitioning/
      Do token sending to back end from inside the embedded iframe!
  Bundle interaction messages to reduce websocket strain
  Compaction
  On domain config, return response with watchable request scope
  Make setting metadata type on object sufficient for triggering postgres update
  Add generic agent cache clearing for testing purposes
  Respect side effects for all patch array items, NOT just first
  Cache downloaded content at agent level
  Throttle naughty clients (protect against infinite loops on the client)
  Add a test for resetting
  Use create-folder-content in agent upload to handle upload of items and return one piece of content that is the content-graph
  Remove create-folder-content from admin app
  Add new vuePersistentRef export to npm module for composition api usage
  Add error if trying to create persistent vue component from composition api component (guide user to use vuePersistentRef)
  Add ability to launch agents
  Bundle synchronously applied patches in mutable proxy as single patch operation
  Verify DNS A Names for candidate host before going through cert provisioning process
  Better protocol for patch request ingestion (feedback for requesting agent?)
  Make serve watch/update config (make function that helps with watcher pattern)

  Domain Administration
    Use DNS TXT record challenge to handle domain claims

  Live db
X   Choose managed postgres vendor
X   Launch to prod with credentials
    Confine firewall ip address access

  Authorization
    Admin specifies access rule queries
    Check for passing access rule query on cross-user state request (later handle cross domain requests with special queries)

  Hosting
    Provision certs like old core

  Monitoring
    Page Request Received
    Agent Scripts Loaded
    Agent WS connection initialized
