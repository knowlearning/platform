  Take postgres out of managed service and use deployable instance
  Dont' rely on redis for base representation of data
    stream all uuids into stored file named domain (stream into gcs as well)
    stream all updates to uuids into file named uuid (stream into gcs as well)
  Auth service needs to associate 1 time use auth token with a domain, so that only auth requests with a token from that domain are treated as valid
    (great redis expiring key use case)
  Throw error instead of returning undefined when cross domain query fails (fails when points at wrong domain/no query configured)
  Semicolons at the end of queries in configuration shouldn't cause them to break
  Add reasonable timeout for JWT token verification (expired tokens might take a long time to come back as expired, causing front end to seem to hang)
  Optimize table updates
  Embeded agent create sessions w/ context
  Embedding agent passes embed start time for embedded agent to record in addition to load + other times

  Per user resource usage tracking
