X Remove special "claims" name usage for domain
X Cross domain queries
  Download archive of entire domain's data (so we can reliably delete live)
  Fix initialization of domain config behavior (Avoid re-doing work)
    More granular edit of admin scopes that correspond to tables
  Authorizer as admin agent
    Can execute arbitrary read queries (like admin domain)
    Can also wrangle shared states (can only write to own like all agents, but can do all authorization/composition of reads/writes)
    Agent.authorize('write', ({ domain, user, scope, patch }, respond) => {...; respond(true/false) })
      only writes from a user to their owned scopes reach the agent. other writes are immediately blocked
      respond returns promise that resolves when authorized write is applied (or immediately on reject)
    Agent.authorize('read', ({ domain, user, scope, }, respond) => {...; respond(true/false) })
  Embeded agent create sessions w/ context
  Embedding agent passes embed start time for embedded agent to record in addition to load + other times
  History Download
  Compaction
  Throttle naughty clients (protect against infinite loops on the client)
  Use create-folder-content in agent upload to handle upload of items and return one piece of content that is the content-graph
  Admin specifies access rule queries
  Check for passing access rule query on cross-user state request (later handle cross domain requests with special queries)
  Fix claiming domains (http challenge doesnt seem to work)
